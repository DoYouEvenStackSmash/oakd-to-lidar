# OAK-D Depth Map to 2D LiDAR Converter for ROS Integration

This repository contains a Python script for converting depth map data from the OpenCV AI Kit with Depth (OAK-D) device into 2D LiDAR data, suitable for integration with Robot Operating System (ROS).

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies and set up the converter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

3. Install the dependencies using pip:


## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the converter using the provided Python script. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your OAK-D device is connected to your system.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the cloned repository directory:

3. Run the Python script:


## Notes

- Make sure your OAK-D device is properly calibrated and configured

- This converter assumes a specific format for the depth map data from the OAK-D device. Ensure that your depth map data conforms to this format for accurate conversion.

- Adjustments may be needed in the code to accommodate variations in the depth map data format or LiDAR output requirements.
